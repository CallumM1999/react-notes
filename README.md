### About 
This is my first React project after completing a Udemy course. 

The project is a flashcards app, used for revision or learning a language. 
The user can create a deck and add/edit cards. The user can then test themselves by looping through each of the cards.

### Installation
Installing the server locally

Initialize package manager.
```
yarn
```

You need to setup the API server locally, here is a [guide](https://github.com/thecallum/react-api#installation).

Now that you have setup the API, you can serve the files locally. 

If you wish to make changes, run:
```
yarn dev-server
```
Otherwise, you can serve the files statically.

First, you need to rebuild the files, as the normal build process will link to the main API server.
```
yarn build-dev
```
Then start the server.
```
yarn start
```
